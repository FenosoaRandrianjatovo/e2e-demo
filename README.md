This repository is an introductory project of end-to-end machine learning, where the different stages of a Machine Learning project lifecycle are discussed. 

This repository contains different Folder :


* data : Contains all the data used for the training part.

* notebooks : Contains training notebook 

* src : We have the script to launch gradio and streamlit for the demo part 


## Getting Started
